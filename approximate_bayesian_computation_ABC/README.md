PROVISIONAL:
'all_fncs4.R' has all the functions you need, just save 'simulation_3.cpp' in your computer and modify the path in the first line of 'all_fncs4.R'.
I suggest running the whole script once, becuase all the fumctions are interconnected.

If you want to use the l^2 meausre, then you need to use 'likelihood_test'

If you want to use the dissimilarity function, then you need to run 'compare'

If you want to try the sequential MC, just modify the example script
