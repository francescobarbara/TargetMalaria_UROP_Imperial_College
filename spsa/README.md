WORK IN PROGRESS:
Wrote an implementation for Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation over Christmas. The code seems to be working fine and is much faster. Didn't have time to comapare performance with sequential MC. Also, my guess is that depending on the choice of step size, there could be cases in which we get stuck not at the global minimum. Looking for such cases (and also finding good heursistics for choosing step-sizes specifically on this problem) would require extensive simulations.
